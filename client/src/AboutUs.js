      <p>
        Welcome to the Digital Library for Rural and Remote Areas! Our mission is to
        provide easy access to educational resources—books, research papers, and more—
        for students and learners in underserved communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        This platform bridges the gap between information and accessibility by allowing
        users to browse, read, and download materials anytime, even with limited internet access.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that education is a right, not a privilege. Our team is committed to
        improving literacy and learning through innovative digital solutions.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>To empower rural youth through free and open access to knowledge.</p>
